# Electra

QUICK Start:
- npm i
- npm i mongoose
- npm i discord.js

create an config.json file in the whole project (not in any folder or other file) with the following code:

{   

    "token": "bot token from the dev portal",
    
    "prefix": "!",
    
    "cocToken": "", // get it from here: https://developer.clashofclans.com/#/
    
    "clashroyaletoken": "", // get it from here: https://royaleapi.com/
    
    "brawlstarstoken": "", // get it from here: https://developer.brawlstars.com/#/
    
    "database": "", // your mongodb cluster key, get it from here: mongodb.com
    
    "randomorg": "" // get it from here: https://api.random.org/dashboard
}

Go into Index and change owners, so you can enjoy all commands ;)
